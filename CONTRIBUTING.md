# Contributing

Interested in contributing to the development and future of `git-doctor`? That's great!

*However...*

This project is still in its infancy. I don't know whether it will even prove a help to anyone yet. So, for now, I am mostly interested in contributions through feedback and direction.

You are obviously still more than welcome to tinker with it as much as you please. Just be aware and keep in mind that everything might change tomorrow.
