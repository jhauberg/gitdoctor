# Contributing

Interested in contributing to the development and future of `git-doctor`? That's great!

However...

This project is in its infancy. I don't even know whether it will actually prove to be a help to anyone. So, for now, I'm mostly interested in contributions through feedback and direction.

You're obviously still more than welcome to tinker with it as much as you please. Just be aware and keep in mind that everything might change tomorrow.
